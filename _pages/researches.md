## Journal articles
1. ["Elementary moves on lattice polytopes"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcta.2019.105200)
with Julien David and Lionel Pournin.<br/>
_Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A. 2020._
We introduce a graph structure on the set of Euclidean polytopes. The vertices of this graph are the d-dimensional polytopes contained in R d and its edges connect any two polytopes that can be obtained from one another by either inserting or deleting a vertex, while keeping their vertex sets otherwise unaffected. We prove several results on the connectivity of this graph, and on a number of its subgraphs. We are especially interested in several families of subgraphs induced by lattice polytopes, such as the subgraphs induced by the lattice polytopes with n or n+ 1 vertices, that turn out to exhibit intriguing properties.


## Conference Proceedings
1. ["The vertices of primitive zonotopes"](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~deza/cm2020.pdf)
with Antoine Deza and Lionel Pournin.<br/>
_Contemporary Mathematics, 2021, vol. 2._
Primitive zonotopes arise naturally in various research areas, such as discrete geometry, combinatorial optimization, and theoretical physics. We provide geometric and combinatorial properties for these polytopes that allow us to estimate the size of their vertex sets. In particular, we show that the logarithm of the complexity of convex matroid optimization is quadratic, and we improve the bounds on the number of generalized retarded functions from quantum field theory. We also give a sharp asymptotic estimate for the number of vertices of a primitive zonotope that, in terms of Minkowski sums, is an intermediate between the permutohedra of types A and B.

2. ["A Markov Chain for lattice polytopes"](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2113/paper13.pdf)
with Julien David and Lionel Pournin.<br/>
_11th GASCom on random generation of combinatorial structures. 2018._
This paper describes an approach to the random sampling of lattice polytopes. The lattice polytopes we are interested in are contained in the hypercube [0, k] d and we refer to them as lattice (d, k)-polytopes. Our approach consists in using a Markov chain whose space of states is the set of all d-dimensional lattice (d, k)-polytopes and whose transitions add or delete vertices following simple, well-defined rules. We prove that this Markov chain provides a uniform random sampler of lattice (d, k)-polytopes, and give a lower bound on the mixing time. We also present a number of experimental results on a selection of values of k in the 2-dimensional case.
